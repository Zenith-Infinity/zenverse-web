# Game Distribution Example Web Project
I create this for final exam project, built with tailwind css & a bit bootstrap. This website is still on development so many things i have to do to perfect it. I will make a list for major update and some update to fix bug or or tidy up some elements on the website.

This website is currently made by myself with reference from some hoyo websites. All copyrights referred to each developer in game list.
